TEMPered is a library for working with the temperature sensors we're using.  The source code is available at: https://github.com/edorfaus/TEMPered

NOTES: you'll need to install HIDAPI before TEMPered. Get the source here:
git clone git://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
       you may need to work some magic to set the root uid/gid on the temperature-streams program once it's installed...

OUR MODIFICATIONS

After cloning TEMPered:
  - Add the temperature-streams.c files to examples
  - Replace the CMakeLists.txt under examples with the one provided here
  - Change the install location to '/usr' instead of '/usr/local'

MAKING DEB FILE

cmake .
make
dh_make --createorig
# modify the debian/* files as necessary to build it properly and have it install to /usr
dpkg-buildpackage

OUR ADDITIONS

The tempy.py file provides a simple Python script for wrapping the temperature-streams program so that the temperature can be read and used within Python.
