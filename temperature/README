NOTE: you'll need to install HIDAPI before TEMPered.

OUR MODIFICATIONS

After cloning TEMPered:
  - Add the temperature-streams.c files to examples
  - Replace the CMakeLists.txt under examples with the one provided here
  - Change the install location to '/usr' instead of '/usr/local'

MAKING DEB FILE

cmake .
make
dh_make --createorig
# modify the debian/* files as necessary to build it properly and have it install to /usr
dpkg-buildpackage

OUR ADDITIONS

The tempy.py file provides a simple Python script for wrapping the temperature-streams program so that the temperature can be read and used within Python.
